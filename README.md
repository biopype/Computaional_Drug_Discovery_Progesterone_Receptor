Choosing the right descriptors to generate a machine learning model for computational drug discovery is important. In this project we analyze performance of four descriptors for progesterone receptor through exploratory data analysis. We then analyze and rank various machine learning models for building a Quantitative Stucture-Activity Relationship (QSAR) model for progesterone receptor.
